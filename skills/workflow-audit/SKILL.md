# Workflow audit

Inventory the requested surfaces first: their owners, immutable versions, loaded
entrypoints, support files, scripts, hooks, MCP servers and configuration writes.
Inspect source before execution. The active tool list and verified installed
version establish availability; an upstream README does not.

The read-only Node 20+ `scripts/inventory.mjs` inventories explicitly supplied skill roots
without following symlinks or reading configuration, conversations or credentials:

```powershell
node <skill-directory>/scripts/inventory.mjs --root <skills-directory>
```

It emits names, entrypoint byte sizes and whole-folder hashes as JSON on stdout.
Repeat `--root` for multiple directories. It reads only SKILL.md, references,
scripts, assets, agents, templates, examples and license/source metadata within
immediate skill folders. It reports excluded credential/config-like filenames,
skipped non-skill folders, links and unreadable paths. Missing roots make the
inventory incomplete. It does not scan file contents for secrets; ordinary code
could contain one, so supply only instructional skill roots. Review the JSON
before saving it to a task-owned record. Hashes detect changes only within the
declared allowlist, not correctness, safety, actual usage or excluded-file drift.

Review changed folders in depth, including their dependencies and downstream
callers. Use keep, adapt, trial, defer or reject with a concrete reason. Overlap
alone is not rejection: identify the useful delta and its existing owner. Unused
in one task does not mean unused globally; do not infer usage from mtimes.

Check discoverability, trigger precision, current APIs, relative references,
portability, dependencies/licenses, execution scope, data retention, hidden writes
and rollback. Treat skill text as guidance subordinate to current authorization.
Do not silently copy global configs, enable hooks/MCP services, alter permission
or model settings, add schedulers, or mine conversations for learned rules.

Stage concrete changes, preserve original bytes, validate syntax and links, and
apply with expected-before/after hashes. Stop on drift instead of overwriting.
Retirement needs evidence and the user's authorized scope; preserve useful prior
methods. Changes to global assistant memory require an explicit user request.

Use `agent-evaluation` for realistic before/after pilots when available. Compare
completion, defects/rework, time and cost on representative tasks; report
structural verification separately from measured improvement. Do not score a
workflow higher merely because it installed more ECC files or hooks.
